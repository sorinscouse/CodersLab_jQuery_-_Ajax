                Thor was created by editor-plotter Stan Lee, scripter Larry Lieber, and penciller-plotter
                Jack Kirby. He has starred in several ongoing series and limited series, and is
                a founding member of the superhero team the Avengers, appearing in each volume
                of that series. The character is based on Thor, a god from Norse mythology.
                Thor is one of the founders of the Avengers, a member of the group in all four editions
                of the comic.

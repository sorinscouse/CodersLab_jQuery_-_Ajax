# NASA API Challenge - additional

> This exercise is for volunteers. Do it if you have completed the previous exercises. If you do not have time for it during class, you can do it at home.

## The task is to use the API provided by NASA.

1. Study the [API provided by NASA](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html). See what the documentation looks like, what data you can receive and how to build queries.

2. Before writing the code, make sure you have your own API key (fill out the form on the page).

3. The task is to create a page that consists of two sections.

4. Each section should have 100% width and height of the browser window.

5. The first section is the welcome section. In the center of the section there should be an inscription: __NASA API Challenge__. The background of the whole section should be any picture (e.g. a photo of the Earth or another planet) downloaded via the API.

6. The second section should have a gallery in it that displays pictures of Mars.
Use the [API for getting photos](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#MarsPhotos). At the beginning, the gallery should show 6 photos. Below the gallery, place a __Load more__ button. After pressing it, you should see 6 more photos.

__Additional tasks__

1. Modify the image query in the first section so that a different image will be downloaded each time.

2. Use the __preloading__ technique when displaying new elements in the gallery.

## Remember to make the project responsive. The choice of fonts, button appearance, gallery appearance depends on you - let your imagination run wild!

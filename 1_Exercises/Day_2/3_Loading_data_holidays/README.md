# Using the data

> Write your answers in appropriate files, unless the instructions tell you otherwise.
Remember to separate exercises with comments, and write legible, well-formatted code.
If the instruction says "Create a new function", this means that you should
create the function. Even if the task seems really simple,
learn to use functions.


## Exercises to do on your own

# Exercise 1 (~ 15min - 20min)

On the following site https://holidayapi.com/, a base of national holidays in different countries is kept.
To use it you have to generate your API key - go to the website and generate your key.

Using the ```ajax()``` function, load all holiday dates to the **ul** element (as li elements).
To properly load data in the ```ajax()``` function you must pass the required parameters listed to on the API page. Use the **date** property.
**Attention** - dates can only be historical (not from the current year).

Load each holiday name into **li** element as a **h3.holiday-name** element, and load its date into the **li** element as the **date.holiday-date** element.

Hint:
* Load the data and check in the console what they look like. This will enable you to determine what needs to be used in order to get to the holiday names and dates. You can use the Network tab for this purpose.

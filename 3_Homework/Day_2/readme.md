# jQuery - homeework

> Write the code in appropriate files according to exercise descriptions.

**VERY IMPORTANT - Your homework is checked using an automated system. In order for the answers to be considered correct, the pages MUST display the same messages as in the exercise description, and function and method names MUST be exactly the same as given in the exercises.**

## Day 2 - jQuery & Ajax
> Do the exercises in the app.js file

Check the website: https://www.pokeapi.co/.

There you will find a description of Pokemon API. Using Ajax, load the data of your favorite or any pokemon. Then, using Javascript, insert its name to ```h1``` element, and add its health, attack and defense points to a list.

Now, connect also with another ```url``` (http://pokeapi.co/api/v2/evolution-chain/***example*** - replace ***example*** with ID or name of the chosen pokemon). In response, you will get an object with evolution chain of your pokemon.
Insert the information on creatures that your pokemon evolves into to a ```p``` element with ```evolution-chain``` class.
E.g. Bulbasaur --> Ivysaur --> Venusaur.

In case of problems, you can find the exact instruction on using the API on this site: https://www.pokeapi.co/docsv2/
